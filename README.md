# JobScraper + Gemini AI

This project performs **job scraping** (using [JobSpy](https://github.com/speedyapply/JobSpy)) and enriches the data with **structured fields** (academic background, technical and soft skills) using the **Gemini API**.  
The results are saved into an **Excel file** ready for analysis.
